Eisen:
	- PEGI 12.																	(violence in a fantacy enviroment and unrealstic violence toards human-like caracters)
	- Correcte naamgeving variabelen methods & classes.
	- Geen onnodige herhaling van code!

	O Beschrijvende comments bij je code.
	O Er is een Potoo verwerkt in het spel.										-> bird room?, random chance that santa is a potoo instead?
	O Externe bestanden gebruikt voor ASCII art.								-> ascii art will be used for boss battle
	O Random event/willekeurige gebeurtenis in je spel.							-> roomgeneration?, items within rooms?, key location?
	O Cover art gemaakt
	V Geen goto!

	Technische eisen:
		V Collection (list & array)
		V Loop (foreach, for, while & do while)
		V Conditional statements (switch statement & if, else if ,else)
		V Method met return type
		V Method met parameters
		V Classes (OOP)
		
		Optionele technische eisen:
			O ASCII art animatie.												-> for boss battle?
			V Collection(dictonary)
			V Class constructors
			V Correcte Access Modifiers


TODO:
	-remove repetition, there is a lot.
	-make the mainloop their methods better, perhaps extract some?
	-add command system to replace the quick and dirty system
	-make the items have an object in their constructor to construct the item with you not able to change the item during runtime
	-merge open and use "commands" (even better, when inplementing the command system, add the feature to have aliases)
	-make actual check for mainloop
	-add summaries
	-find a better way to have return doors

	BUGS:
		-consumed on use doesn't do anything (rooms, but probably players too)
		-you're unable to have more than 1 door (more a portal) in a room.


FLAWS: (a.k.a. lazyness.. although, please fix as much as possible please)
	-you can only move forwards in the map because you can only have one door per room
	-you can only have one door per room
	-any key can be used to unlock any door

IDEAS:
	-you need to gain more weight to eat heavier objects.
	-to know your weight you first need to find.. one of those weighing things... yea.....
	-some items dont have a constant weight. (if non-negative ints are allowed => (0, 20) - 10 )
